Dice_LEDS


GOAL : 	
	Turning on leds like dice cupe and increase number by pressing on button



Steps : 
	Initialize pin0 in portD as input connect to pull_up button then 
		polling pin to check input on it

	When press button application increases the num var (represent the number on dice) in range from
		0 to 6 then goes to DICE_PATTERN function, which checks the num. 
		if it's odd : 
			it'll just drive high on pin connected in the middle of the dice because 
			always odd number is after an even number.
		if it's even : 
			i'll need to check num if it's zero :
				i'll just turn off the leds;
			other :
				that mean the number is even and non_zero so i need to drive on pin1 
				low to close the dot in the middle of dice then drive high to
				the pins represent the number and it doesn't depend on the code but
				depend on the connection circuit.

Tricks :
	Making WHILE loop handle human speed to check button is not pressed.
	
	The way of connection circuit is also a trick to simplify the code.
